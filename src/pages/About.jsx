            <p className="">Hello, my name is Ben Whann. I am an aspiring software engineer. My whole life I have really taken joy in building and creating things.
             Writing code has become a productive outlet for that part of me over the last year or so. I am currently proficient in a variety of full stack technologies. 
             These skills are demonstrated in the many projects I have worked on over the course of the web development bootcamp that I have recently completed, though I am particularly 
             comfortable with the MERN stack. My favorite projects are showcased on the portfolio page of this site. So feel free to take a stroll through my portfolio, and feel free to contact me if you see anything that piques your interest!</p>
